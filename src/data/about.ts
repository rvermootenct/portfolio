  bio: `
My name is Ryan Vermooten, and I am a software developer working primarily with React, TypeScript, Node and AWS. I have been working in the software development industry for over 7 years, and in that time, I have been able to meet vastly different business needs over many high profile projects. 

I have a fondness for upskilling juniors and supporting the growth of development teams through mentorship and peer programming. 
  
I am known to be a tinkerer, and spend much of my free time on DIY projects that incorporate elements of IoT and electronics, and I like to keep my mind busy by continuously studying and adding tools to my arsenal. Currently I am learning about cyber security and its multitude of applications, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. 
  
I live in Cape Town with my wife, who also works in the software development industry, and my amazing dog, who unfortunately does not. I really enjoy making people laugh and seeing the humour in every day, and consider myself a team player who easily adapts to new environments and challenges.
