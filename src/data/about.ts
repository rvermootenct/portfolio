  bio: `
    Hi there, my name is Ryan Vermooten, and I'm a thirty-something South African currently living in Muizenberg, Cape Town.
    I enjoy spending time at home working on little DIY projects often involving IOT that keep me busy. I also have a very inquisitive mind and love learning new things, Iâ€™m currently learning all about internet security and really enjoying it.
    I'm happily married and have a very sweet doggo named Chula.
    I enjoy trying to make people laugh. I am also known to sing to myself about things I see around me.
    That's about all I can think to write about myself, but check out these referrals for more info:
