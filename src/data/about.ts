  bio: `Hi there, my name is Ryan Vermooten, and I'm a thirty-something South African currently living in Muizenberg, Cape Town.
    I enjoy spending time at home working on little DIY projects often involving IoT that keep me busy.
    I have a very inquisitive mind and love learning new things, I'm currently learning all about cyber security and really enjoying it.
    
    I'm happily married and have a very sweet doggo.
    I enjoy trying to make people laugh, I am known to sing to myself about things I see around me.
    
    That's about all I can think to write about myself, but check out these referrals for more info:
