        Worked on a greenfields project implementing a video calling service.
        The app at a high level is a marketplace for vetted chanellers and people looking for their services
        to find each other and use the service to have a video conference.
        The app utilised webRTC through a third party service called 100ms to build the application.

        Over the course of my employment at Nona my knowledge of technologies, frameworks and tools

        utilised CI/CD best practices and helped build out multiple mobile and web based projects.
        One thing I greatly enjoyed during my time with the subtitle was having the opportunity to work with and to mentor more junior people on my team.
